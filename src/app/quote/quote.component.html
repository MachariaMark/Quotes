                    Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.<br>
                    Imagination is more important than knowledge.<br>
                    If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.<br>
                    Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.<br>
                    Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.<br>
                    No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.<br>
                    The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.<br>
                    I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.<br>
                    Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.<br>
                    Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.
